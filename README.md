Predicting Rain in Australia
==============================

Project Aim
------------
The aim of the project is to predict if it will rain tomorrow based on todays weather.

Data Exploration
------------
The given Dataset from Australia has 23 different columns and contains 145460 data entrys.
The target column is RainTomorrow, which is a binary variable (true/false). The target is unevenly distibuted (lot less rainy days).
The Data for today contains information about the date, the city, temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, clouds, sunshine and rain. Most variables are numeric. Categorical values are the location , wind related values (e.g. wind direction) and if it rains today (true/false).
The dataset contains measurements from 49 citys/places.

? How do we want to proceed with missing values? I suggest that we delete values with over 10% of missing values for the modelling

First Observation
------------
If it rains today, there is 50% chance that it also rains tomorrow. If it dows not rain today, it will most likely also not rain tomorrow.

Preprocessing data
------------
- How to proceed with nans?
- transform date into year, month (and day) (I think the day should be irrelevant for the weather. Month and year could have an influence)
- encode RainToday and RainTomorrow in binary variable (0/1)
- encode location and variables for wind direction (Do you have a prefered Encoding?)
- Other preprocessing steps?
